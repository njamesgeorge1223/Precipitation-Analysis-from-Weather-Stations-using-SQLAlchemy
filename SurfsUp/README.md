# Climate Analysis Using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask

In this project I am analyzing two datasets which relate to weather station information over the course of one year in Hawaii in 2016-2017. This information was analyzed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, and Pandas and Matplotlib in Python. A Flask API is created to store all the information.

##organization In this repository you will find a Resources folder which holds the sqlite file as well as the 2 csv's that are used in this analysis. You will also find climate_starter.ipynb which is the Jupyter notebook file that contains my innitial analysis. There python file for my app named app.py, and the png visualization that I created to map precipitation.

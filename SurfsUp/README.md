# Climate Analysis Using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask

In this project I analyze precipitation data collected by weather stations in Honolulu, Hawaii.  To accomplish this task, I use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib in the IPython notebook, ClimatePy.ipynb.  From these queries, I created an API in Python using Flask for later development.
